- ⚡ Fun fact(s):
  1) It took me 300+ job applications and 3 tech positions at uni to become a SWE.
  2) I also geek out on beautiful clean code backends and performant PC builds on a budget.
  3) I have an extremely toxic love-hate relationship with mathematics (I know it's bad for my mental health but I can't stop).
 
- 🔥 Hot take(s):
  1) Full-stack developers are just backend devs who know how to copy React components from Stack Overflow.
  3) AI can't ever replace engineers fully. However, it should be included as part of the tech stack cuz everyone uses it.
  4) AWS is called 'the cloud' because, just like your money, it appears for a second and then vanishes into thin air ☁️.

Started coding in 2018. My ultimate goal is to be an engineer, not just a SWE. I like building with both my hands and VS Code.
